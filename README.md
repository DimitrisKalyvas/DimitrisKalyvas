- 👋 Hi, I’m @DimitrisKalyvas
- 👀 I’m a level & game designer with experience in production, LOC and QA.
- 🏆 I've worked on Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, Age of Empires 4 & Age of Mythology: Retold
- 🌱 I'm always learning new things, currently focusing on Lua, aspiring to improve my technical design skills.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on projects right now, as I have my hands full working for Forgotten Empires and making SIGNAL LOST (https://store.steampowered.com/app/3079180/SIGNAL_LOST/), among other stuff.
- 📫 My email is dimitrismarioskalyvas@gmail.com
